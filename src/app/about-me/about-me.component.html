        <p>I LOVE DEV</p>
        <p>
          an the deep insight into programming made me realize that´s exactly
          the right decision for me. I love developing web applications and
          facing new challenges. <br />
          I really found my passion! With every project completing, with every
          new challenge I face, <br />
          I Always learn a bit more and I never get bored. I invest a lot of
          time in coding and I´m loving it!

        <p>I SEARCHED</p>
        <p>
          the right way to move forward. At a certain point, I wanted to learn
          faster and more efficiently, so I decided to seek professional help.
          My path led me to the Developer Academy in Munich in March 2022.
          Beside my main job I learned there in shortest time the fundamental
          knowledge for the frontend web development. I completed a lot of
          different projects there, individually and in groups.

        <p>MY FUTURE</p>
        <p>
          is development. So i would like to deepen my knowledge in the field of
          frontend development and I am looking for a chance to join an
          interesting team, to support this team and develop professionally.
