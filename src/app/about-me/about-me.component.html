        <p>MY JOURNEY BEGAN</p>

        <p>
          as a supervisor in an agency for personnel and product services, I was
          able to supervise and develop many projects.

        <p>I LOVE DEV</p>
        <p>
          an this deep insight into programming made me realize that I had made
          exactly the right decision. I love developing web applications and
          facing new challenges. I really found my passion! With every project I
          complete, with every new challenge I face, I always learn a little bit
          more and I never get bored. I invest a lot of time in coding and I
          love it!

        <p>I SEARCHED</p>
        <p>
          the right way to move forward. At a certain point, I wanted to learn
          faster and more efficiently, so I decided to seek professional help.
          My path led me to the Developer Academy in Munich in March 2022.
          Beside my main job I learned there in shortest time the fundamental
          knowledge for the frontend web development. I completed a lot of
          different projects there, both individually and in groups.

        <p>NEW CHALLENGES</p>
        <p>
          I would like to deepen my knowledge in the field of frontend
          development and am therefore looking for a chance to join an
          interesting team, to support this team and develop professionally as
          well as personally.
